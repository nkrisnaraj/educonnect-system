Time-Based Exam Availability System - Implementation Summary
============================================================

This document verifies that the time-based exam availability system has been successfully implemented.

âœ… BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

1. Enhanced get_available_exams() function:
   - Calculates exam time windows based on date, start_time, and duration
   - Determines availability status: not_started, available, expired, completed
   - Returns availability messages for each status
   - Provides remaining time for active exams

2. Updated get_exam_details() function:
   - Checks time availability before allowing exam access
   - Returns 403 Forbidden for exams outside time window
   - Provides specific error messages for timing issues

3. Enhanced start_exam_attempt() function:
   - Validates exam timing before creating submission
   - Prevents starting expired or future exams
   - Returns appropriate error messages

âœ… FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

1. Updated Student Exams Page (/students/[id]/exams/page.jsx):
   - New availability status badges with icons
   - Time-based filtering (Upcoming, Available, Expired, Completed)
   - Availability messages showing exact time windows
   - Disabled buttons for unavailable exams
   - Color-coded status indicators

2. Enhanced Exam Taking Page (/students/[id]/exams/take/[examId]/page.jsx):
   - Error handling for time-based restrictions
   - User-friendly messages when exam is not available
   - Automatic redirection for timing violations

âœ… AVAILABILITY LOGIC:

Exam Status Determination:
- NOT_STARTED: Current time < exam start time
- AVAILABLE: Start time â‰¤ current time â‰¤ end time  
- EXPIRED: Current time > end time
- COMPLETED: Student has submitted the exam

Example Scenarios:
- Exam: 2025-09-28, 10:00 AM, Duration: 1 hour
- Available window: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM on 2025-09-28
- Before 10:00 AM: "Not Started" - Shows start time
- 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM: "Available Now" - Shows remaining time
- After 11:00 AM: "Expired" - Shows end time

âœ… USER EXPERIENCE:

For Students:
1. Clear visual indicators of exam availability
2. Exact timing information (when exam starts/ends)
3. Remaining time display for active exams
4. Prevention of access to unavailable exams
5. Helpful error messages explaining timing restrictions

For Instructors:
1. Enhanced answer key interface with visual indicators
2. Clear marking of correct answers with green highlights
3. Question type-specific instructions for answer keys

âœ… SECURITY FEATURES:

1. Server-side time validation prevents client manipulation
2. Multiple validation points (get details, start attempt, submit)
3. Proper error handling with specific status codes
4. Timezone-aware calculations
